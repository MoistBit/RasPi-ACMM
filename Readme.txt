Inspired by the OP-1 and OTTO from github @ https://github.com/topisani/OTTO, I have decided to make my own build 
aswell using an Arduino Uno and a Rasberry Pi 3b+ as my HID's. Im using Python 3 for interfacing the Arduino's USB 
connection to Sonic Pi. This is a work in progress and will be updated daily or weekely until the final product is
complete. 

I believe that as a novice programmer, using Python and Sonic Pi seems to be a viable option for customization, 
simplicity and versatility. I plan on working on visuals aswell after the core has been established, containing 
a menu for switching between drum kits and synths aswell as visuals for levels, notes, dials etc. The visuals will
be displayed onto a RasPi Zero W housing a 2.8" TfT display. The tutorial for that can be found at
